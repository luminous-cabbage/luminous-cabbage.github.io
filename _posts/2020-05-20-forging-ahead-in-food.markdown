title: "Forging Ahead in Food"

It’s become clear that my initial plans require some modification. I’d come up with the idea of blogging about Charlotte’s restaurant scene just as the coronavirus had reached North Carolina---a period of time when recovery and reopening seemed just over the horizon. 

Since then, many restaurateurs have voiced concerns, often dire ones, about the future of the industry. *Top Chef* judge Tom Colicchio is [quoted](https://www.thedailybeast.com/top-chef-host-tom-colicchio-warns-coronavirus-could-kill-75-percent-of-restaurants) in The Daily Beast as saying only a quarter of US restaurants would survive being closed for the pandemic. Another such tidbit of misery: In an [interview](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/magazine/david-chang-restaurants-covid19.html) with NYT Magazine, David Chang, head of Momofuku Noodle Bar and related enterprises, questioned whether the Trump administration would do anything to support independently-owned restaurants. And now there’s Gabrielle Hamilton’s [piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/magazine/closing-prune-restaurant-covid.html) in the same magazine, in which she can only hope there’ll be room for her two-top, conversation-oriented Prune in the UberEats-ified New York of the future.

In her article, [“Why the Coronavirus Pandemic Could Change Dining as We Know It, Forever”](https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/03/why-the-coronavirus-pandemic-could-change-dining-as-we-know-it-forever), Lisa Abend paints a portrait of a deeply precarious industry, which continues to operate on razor-thin margins even as it’s enjoyed a resurgence in popular acclaim. All the Netflix specials and book deals in the world cannot change the laws of biology to make your produce any less perishable, nor can they do away with the legion of line cooks and wait staff that make it all work. Success in other sectors of the economy might be defined by cash reserves or market share, but in the restaurant business, survival is success. Warding off insolvency is success.

But what about those Netflix specials? I remember only ten years ago, when I was in middle school, and my only exposure to food media was Food Network. The only chefs we knew about at home were Alton Brown and Ina Garten. (Remember Pete Wells’ [takedown](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html) of a Guy Fieri establishment, composed of forty-nine rhetorical questions? Because I do.) That was before “Netflix” had become a near-universal shorthand for Millenial sloth, and before anyone had heard of Instagram, let alone made a career out of it. That was before YouTube outfits like Vice’s [*Munchies*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0xDAUXPc8c) pioneered younger hosts who were excited about the food all around them. Before series like *Chef’s Table* and *Salt Fat Acid Heat* broadened Americans’ perceptions of what food could mean and what it could taste like. As Abend observes, it’s not uncommon nowadays for a teenager to dream of Michelin stars to her name.

I don’t know how any of these trends will play out in Charlotte. I mean, it’s hard to imagine new restaurants not opening to replace the ones that have closed, and if social media is any indication, one of the first things Americans will do post-quarantine is eat out. But it makes you wonder, just where will they be eating? Will it be at the Cheesecake Factory, that paean to insipid, undifferentiated American-ness? Or will it be at the farm-to-table experiment, or the Latin American bakery? I’m looking at the places on my list like [Kindred](https://www.bonappetit.com/restaurants-travel/best-new-restaurants/article/kindred-no-7), a husband-and-wife outfit that serves the most luscious milk bread, or like [Lucy’s Bake and Deli](https://www.yelp.com/biz/lucys-bake-and-deli-stallings), with its display cases chock full of empanadas and sundry turnovers, and I can only hope they’ll stick around.
