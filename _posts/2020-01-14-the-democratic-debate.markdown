title: "the democratic debate"

Tonight's Democratic debate was, if anything at all, incredibly difficult to watch.

Putting aside the impassioned moral pleas and the trotting out of haggard talking points, the reigning emotion of the night was one of embarrassment, on the part of the candidates as well as everyone watching.
Biden's cringe-inducing overture to "brown and black" people, which only drew attention to his age and his staid demeanor; Klobuchar's tortured, ultimately failed remembrance of a certain Gov. Kelly; the dust-up between Warren and Sanders over the precise meaning of "thirty years ago"---these moments of slippage in which the finely-tuned spectacle of a nationally-televised event began to show its contrivances---they all came together to make for a uniquely strained and unpleasant viewing experience.

It's funny because I've spent more time watching SNL skits of Democractic debates than I have watching the actual debates.
Next to their comedic doppelgangers, the real, existing Democractic candidates looked palid, awfully fleshy.
Sanders was perhaps the worst hit of the contenders.
He appeared worn.
His bags and lines and his unbreaking grimace hung on tenterhooks from a point slightly above his head.
Klobuchar fared little better, with her toothy, gum-bearing smile.
Buttigieg seemed to have trouble keeping his smirk under control, as did Steyer with his boyish grin.

If this sounds cruel or ungenerous, this is because I could not watch the debate without feeling some twinge of indentification with the candidates and their undeniable imperfection.
What it must be like to perform your best, most thoughtful and authoritative self for an audience of millions, to have a gaggle of staffers molding and filing away at your every tic and tendency, and to manage all this on a campaign schedule that strains against the most basic human needs for rest, privacy, and solitude.
These are pressures alien to the cast members of Saturday Night Live, and it shows.
