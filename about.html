This is a blog about food and politics. It's a place for me to sort through my
experiences in a way that might be interesting to others.

I'm currently working on a project of food criticism, to do with the culture of
Charlotte. You can find out more about it <a href="/2020/05/10/linck-fellowship-statement">here</a>.

This website was made using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static
site generator. It's pretty sweet.

You can email me at <a href="mailto:laurence.lu@yale.edu">laurence.lu@yale.edu</a>. Please do! I live for that shit.
